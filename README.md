# DNA_and_cipher_translation
This case study was like a step in the field of bioinformatics, where i considered the final stage of the process of gene expression from a computational perspective and how to convert a genetic code getten from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_207618.2) to its corresponding protein sequence. Moreover, i could extend such idea, which is the decoding, to shift-based ciphers and use it to implement Caesar cipher.
